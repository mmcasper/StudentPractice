This is a Console Application built using C# in Visual Studio
This is in fulfillment of the Project Requirements of CodeLouisville for the January 2019 session.

I have built a simple app to retrieve a student file, and ask them for input about how many minutes they practced each day.
The minutes are then added up and saved back to the JSON file. 
The next time the student logs in, the previous week's total is reported.
